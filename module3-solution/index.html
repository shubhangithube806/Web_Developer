            <h4>Chicken</h4>
            <p>You know what they say—"Chicken: It's what's for dinner." It's true, chicken breasts, thighs (our favorite cut), or even a whole bird all have a spot on our
              kitchen table. Unfortunately, that can mean falling into a dinner rut much too easily for our liking. If you’re like us and just can’t bear to make your (or your family’s)
                old standbys for the umpteenth time, we’ve got you. Get inspired with our list of best chicken dinner recipes—you’ll be sure to find a new weeknight favorite.
              We bet you’ve got a classic like chicken Parmesan in your rotation already, so let’s switch it up. We’ve included some fun spins on it here, like chicken Parm pasta
                (with everything bagel seasoning), our air fryer chicken Parm, and our chicken Parm soup. And Parmesan isn’t just for tomato sauce! We love it just as much in a garlicky, 
                lemon cream sauce, like in our lemon asparagus chicken pasta, or paired with bread crumbs, like in our slow-cooker garlic-Parmesan chicken. And don’t even get us started on
                Alfredo sauce. We’ve included our favorite recipe for chicken Alfredo and a few new ones too. Our fave? Chicken tikka Alfredo. Somehow the Parmesan + curry works!

            <h4>Beef</h4>
            <p>To say beef is a versatile food is an understatement. Just about every country eats beef, all the way from Japan to Brazil to Spain and all over the United States. It can 
              be prepared in many ways including grilled, fried, baked, roasted, slow-cooked, and even raw, and there are a lot of different cuts to choose from.
            Beef is so versatile it can be the star of fancy dinners, quick lunches, simple stews, and more. No matter how beef is eaten, it can easily showcase worldwide flavors and 
              culinary creativity.

            <h4>Sushi</h4>
            <p>sushi, a staple rice dish of Japanese cuisine, consisting of cooked rice flavoured with vinegar and a variety of vegetable, egg, or raw seafood garnishes and served cold.
              Restaurants specializing in sushi abound in Japan, where subtleties of preparation find a discriminating clientele, and the dish has gained popularity in the United States 
              and elsewhere (see also sashimi).
              Nigiri-zushi is a hand-formed oblong of rice topped with sliced raw seafood and a dab of wasabi (a green paste made of true wasabi or horseradish); the ingredients of oshi-zushi 
              are pressed to shape in a mold.
